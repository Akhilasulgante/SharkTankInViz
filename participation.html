          a challenging task, especially when it comes to evaluating the worth
          of an entire industry. In this chart, we provide you with a
          comprehensive overview of the difference in valuation that was asked
          by companies and the valuation that sharks offered for the company.
          We have considered the average valuation ask of all companies of a
          industry and the average of valuation that sharks offered. This is
          specfically helpful for prospect Shark Tank participants to
