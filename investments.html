      An overview of the investment
    </h2>
    <div style="padding-top: 1%; font-family: Poppins">
      <p>
        Our first step of exploration is knowing how many companies that
        appeared on Shark Tank got investments from Shark on TV. Through
        analyzing the investment patterns, it is apparent that not all companies
        are able to secure funding from the Sharks. While some businesses are
        able to successfully secure investment, others do not receive any
        offers. In the below chart we see that out of 320 companies that
        appeared on Shark Tank 216 of it received offers from the Sharks, that
        is 72%. It means that there are high possibility of receiving an offer
        from the sharks. Out of these companies, 81.5% accepted the offer made
        my sharks possibly after negotitaions. 18.5% of the companies did not
        accept the offer from the sharks. Overall we see that Food industry
        dominates all categories.

      Sharks and Investment Strategy: Analyzing their Mutual and Individual

      <p>
        Let us analyze if our sharks like to invest Individually or prefer a
        collaborator. Having multiple Sharks can benefit the company as they
        will have multiple mentors to support and guide them. There is no doubt
        that startups also hope to get multiple sharks on board to grow their
        companies. In the chart below, we can explore the companies that got
        joint investments from sharks and the ones that got Individual
        investments. A line between a big blue circle and the smaller ones
        indicates that the company got investment from that particular shark. If
        the company is attached to more than one shark then it means that the
        corresponding sharks are investors in that company.<br />
        Continuing our exploration of Peyush's investment, in the below chart we
        can see the companies that Peyush, Aman, and Vineeta have invested in

      In conclusion, we hope you enjoyed exploring Investment patterns on Shark
      Tank India at different stages and increasing granularity. As we delved
      deeper into the data, we discovered some interesting insights into the
      investment behavior of the Sharks. <br />
      we noticed that the Sharks had a diverse investment portfolio, with
      investments spanning across various sectors such as healthcare,
      technology, consumer goods, and many more. This indicates that they were
      open to investing in different industries, provided the business idea was
      compelling and had strong growth potential. <br />
      Furthurmore, we also saw that sharks that prefer investing with a peer
      shark. This will not only cut down their risk but the company will also
      benefit a lot from having two sharks on board as investors.
      <br />
      <br />
      We hope that our charts provided a good medium for entrepreneurs and
      investors alike to derive insights and understand the Investment pattern
      on Shark Tank India.
